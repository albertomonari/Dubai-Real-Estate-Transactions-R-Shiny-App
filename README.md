It is well known that Dubai has experienced exponential growth over the last 30 years: both in terms of population and construction. 
In fact, only 10% of Dubai's population is indigenous: 90% is made up of immigrants, a large proportion of whom are construction workers.

The aim of this project is to build a basic interactive application to explore the development of the Dubai real estate market from 1995 to 2020.

The application is developed entirely in the R language, with the R Shiny graphical interface.

To open it locally, just run the script [dubai_real_estate_app.R](dubai_real_estate_app.R) in R Studio, while on the server it is uploaded [here](https://albertomonari.shinyapps.io/real_estate_dubai/).

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andresgtn/dubai-real-estate-transactions) used is freely available on Kaggle.

The application offers two graphs showing the price trend and the price per square metre over time. The user can modify various parameters such as the neighbourhood of Dubai, 
the property type, the property subtype, the payment procedure,  whether or not the property purchased already existed, the range of time and the range of square metres.
